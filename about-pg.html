            Founded in 2022, Anika Richards and Soraya Elchehimi came together to create an all-in-one tool known today as Optiqe. Optiqe came about when the two realized their everyday routines lacked extra functionality to help them have efficiency in their days. With Anika having an extensive techincal developping background, alongside Soraya's expertise in product design, the two came together to create Optiqe for the every day person on-the-go. <br><br>
            Their hope is to utilize the advancements in technology, push the boundaries of design and ultimately, utlize thier skills to progress the field of technology so that every indiviudal can experience life to the fullest. Optiqe is just the start. <br><br>
